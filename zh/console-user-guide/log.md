!!! tip "Note"
    * Traffic logs are retained for a maximum of 7 days or 50,000 entries. If either condition is exceeded, the oldest logs are deleted in order (overwritten).
        * If long-term storage is required, it is recommended to use **Remote Log Transfer Settings** in the **Settings** tab.
